Bandile leather boot

R899

Sign up for the military trend with these chunky leather boots. Rugged and comfortable, they feature a high collar with a long lace-up front. They pair well with jeans, a T-shirt and an anorak, but look even better with tapered cargo trousers with elasticated cuffs and an oversized tee.
