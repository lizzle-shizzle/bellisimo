\section{Vision}
The core of the system will be catalogues of items and their prices. Since Bellisimo is involved in clothing and food, the catalogues will have to ensure that these lines are well maintained. Sales and specials in each line will have to be accounted for and managed.

\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}
